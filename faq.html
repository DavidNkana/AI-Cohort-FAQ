            <h3>Tips for achieving the best accuracy:</h3>
            <p>1. To ensure that AI Cohort explains the specific sections you're interested in, try to provide clear and concise prompts. AI Cohort sometimes provides suboptimal explanations when presented with lengthy code snippets.</p>
            <p>2. AI Cohort understands class, variable, and method names, so providing accurate names can improve its performance. If your names are vague or inaccurate, consider updating them. Alternatively, you can use more generic substitutes like "foo", "bar", or "_".</p>
            <p>3. AI Cohort has many capabilities, similar to those of ChatGPT. It can write code, answer search engine-like queries, teach, write essays, create resumes and cover letters, and more. Its capabilities depend on the quality of your prompts, so be clear and specific.</p>
            <p>4. Unlike ChatGPT, AI Cohort cannot remember previous conversations.</p>

            <h3>Which programming languages does AI Cohort support?</h3>
            <p>1. AI Cohort works with most programming languages, including Python, Rust, C, C++, Java, Ruby, JavaScript, C#, Go, CSS, JSX (React), and many others. It can also handle rarer languages like COBOL, AutoHotKey, and V. If you're unsure whether your language is supported, try it out.</p>

            <h3>Can AI Cohort explain anything in any way you like?</h3>
            <p>1. Thanks to GPT-3 technology, the answer is yes! You can ask AI Cohort to explain anything in the way that best suits your needs, from simple explanations to more complex ones.</p>
            <p>However, AI Cohort may occasionally provide inaccurate responses and cannot learn from feedback. Nonetheless, with further development, it has the potential to perform even better.</p>

            <h3>Does AI Cohort identify and explain algorithms?</h3>
            <p>AI Cohort is designed to explain real-world probelems and give solutions.</p>

            <h3>Can I use AI Cohort to create a website?</h3>
            <p>Although not as impressive as ChatGPT, AI Cohort can help you create a website, depending on the quality of your prompt.</p>
            <p>However, it is important to note that AI Cohort is not designed to write code perfectly or generate code from scratch as intended by the user. Instead, it can be helpful in debugging your code and identifying potential issues.</p>
