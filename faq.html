            <h3>Tips for best accuracy</h3>
            <p>1. Help keep AI Cohort focused- use it to explain the specific sections you're interested in. AI Cohort sometimes explains code suboptimally when you use more code.</p>
            <p>2. AI Cohort understands class, variable, and method names. If your names are accurate, AI Cohort will perform better. If your names are vague, try to improve your names. If your names may be inaccurate, try replacing them with vaguer substitutes foo, bar, or _</p>
            <p>3. AI Cohort can do most things chatGPT can do including but not limited to Programming, Answer like a search engine, write scripts, lyrics, teach, essays and do your homework, write professional resumes and cover letters etc. It's really based on your idea and creativity in prompts so be clear with your prompts.</p>
            <p>3. AI Cohort has most chatGPT capabilities except it cannot remeber previous conversations you had with it.</p>

            <h3>What languages does AI Cohort support?</h3>
            <p>1. AI Cohort works with almost all programming languages, including Python, Rust, C, C++, Java, Ruby, JavaScript, C#, Go, CSS, JSX (React), and many more. Rarer languages such as COBOL, AutoHotKey, and V also work well. The best way to find out if your language is supported is to try it and see.</p>

            <h3>Can AI Cohort explain anything in whatever way you want</h3>
            <p>1. Oddly enough, thanks to the GPT-3 technology, the answer is YES!. It can answer any prompt and you can ask it how you would like it to explain it to you. With compexity or like a 5 years old child.</p>
            <p>However AI Cohort may give wrong answers and can not learn anything you teach it. This is a hickup but with further development it will be able to perform amazingly.</p>

            <h3>Does AI Cohort identify and explain algorithms?</h3>
            <p>AI Cohort is intended for explaining real-world code.</p>

            <h3>Can I create website with AI Cohort</h3>
            <p>While it's not as impressive as chatGPT. It really depends on how you constuct your single prompt.</p>
